Boggle Woggle helps you manage your ads (advertisements) on your blog

== Description ==

Boggle Woggle helps you manage your ads (advertisements) on your blog. You can copy/paste your ad code (for example from google adsense) into ad units or ad widgets.

For each ad unit and ad widget you can specify where it should be displayed and on what type of content (posts, pages, archives, categories, home, search) and how it should be alligned.

Of course instead of ads you can use any text or html in the units so you can use it for all kinds of purposes.

If you have any ideas for other features or things that could be changed please leave me a message on the boggle woggle page: <a href="http://www.shops2b.co.uk/boggle-woggle-wordpress-ad-manager/">boggle woggle</a>
